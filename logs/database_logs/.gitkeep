Database Logs Directory
=====================

"Like the time vault messages of Hari Seldon, these logs preserve 
the historical record of our data operations. Each entry tells a 
story of the Foundation's daily work in maintaining the collected 
knowledge of the markets."

Purpose:
--------
- Stores database operation logs
- Tracks data ingestion history
- Maintains audit trail of updates
- Records system performance metrics

This directory is maintained in git through this file, ensuring 
the log storage location persists across clones.

"To understand the future, one must study the past."
- Hari Seldon's First Law of Psychohistory
